Home Page
The Homepage features a banner which includes 2 combined images and a brief description notifying the consumers of a new restock for snacks. There is also a call to action in order to draw the potential prospects to 'shop' the snacks. Beneath the banner, there is a short display of cards, presenting the user with new products which they can directly add to their 'bag' if they wish. As you scroll down there is an icons section notifying the consumer of cool features The Nest offers such as free shipping (on orders over $40), Gift wrapping, and Free samples! Who doesn't love free samples, am I right?

Products Page
The Products page also has a banner, featuring a big image of a product along with a description of the page's overall purpose. The rest of the page shows all products in a card format. It spans, individually on smaller screens and gradually doubles as you increase the screen. At the bottom of the products page these is a footer (also feature throughout the whole website on each page). It allows users to input their email to sign up for fake subscriptions and emails for promotions. It also shows customer service links, information about the company and the social media icons.
